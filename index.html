    <h2>History Of Bees</h2>

    <p>
      Bees have existed for 130 million years and helped many plants depend on
      bees.Bees have been around for millions of years, and they have been an
      important part of human history for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians
      were the first to domesticate bees, and they used them to produce honey
      and wax for candles and other products. Bees were also important to the
      ancient Greeks and Romans, who used them for pollination and honey
      production. In the Middle Ages, beekeeping became more popular, and
      beekeepers began to use more sophisticated methods to manage their
      colonies. In the 18th century, the invention of the moveable-frame hive
      made beekeeping easier and more efficient. In the 20th century, the
      introduction of pesticides and other chemicals caused a decline in bee
      populations, and beekeepers began to focus on more natural methods of
      beekeeping. Today, bees are still an important part of the agricultural
      industry, and they are also important pollinators of wild plants.

    <h3>Why should we care about bees?</h3>

    <p>
      Three-fourths of the world‚Äôs flowering plants and about 35 percent of the
      world‚Äôs food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce. This
      demonstrates the importance of pollination in global food systems. In
      addition to supporting agriculture, pollinators also support the
      reproduction of flowering plants that:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Produce half of the world‚Äôs oils, fibers, and raw materials</li>
      Produce half of the world‚Äôs oils, fibers, and raw materials
      <li>Prevent soil erosion</li>
      <li>Increase carbon sequestration</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Bees are vital to our ecosystem. Research shows that over 100,000 species
      of plants would become extinct if the pollinating function of bees was to
      cease. This includes apples, melons, cranberries, pumpkins, squash,
      broccoli, and many more. Without bees, you can say goodbye to many of your
      favorite foods!
