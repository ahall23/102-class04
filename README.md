What is wireframe?

Wireframe is a practice used by UX designers to help them plan and design websites, apps, and or products. Its a great use to satisfy a customer wants for a product.

Wire Frames is an outline of what you want your website to look like and you can use software like [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) or [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create. Its best to start off with paper and pen so you can have a clear idea what you want but if not you can also use [UXPin](https://www.uxpin.com/)

## HTML Basics

HTML is a markup Language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller.

> 1.The opening tag:<>
> 2.The closing tag: </>
> 3.The content: is the text 4. The element: is the opening and closing tag and content together. <p> hi there,</p>

## Nesting elements
